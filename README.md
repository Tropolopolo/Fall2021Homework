# PreviousWork
This is a repository for all the work I have done throughout my career at the University of Texas at Arlington.
These documents were mainly used for homework, or for my own purposes (typically just trying something out, regardless of if I finish it or not).
Many of these documents are incomplete or broken and are not intended to be completed, but I want to keep them here in case I ever want to pick them back up again.
